/*

A short is the smallest integral type designed to represent integer values. The
C++ standard guarantees that it is a minimum of 16 bits. An int is at least as
large as a short. A long is at least twice as large as an int. A long long is
at least twice as large as a long.

An unsigned integral type represents values from 0 to 2 ^ n - 1, where n is the
number of bits allocated for the type. A signed integral type is guaranteed to
represent an even number of values on either side of 0, from
- 2 ^ (n - 1) to 2 ^ (n - 1).

A float is guaranteed to have at least 6 significant digits. A double is
guaranteed to have at least 10.
